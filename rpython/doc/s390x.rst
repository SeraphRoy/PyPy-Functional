Translation on the IBM Mainframe
================================

Redhat Linux (rel65)
--------------------

Unfortunatley there is no ffi development package (yet?), thus
one needs to install this manually.
libffi is not installed on the rl65.
This can be resolved by installing it locally (./configure && make install) and
adjusting th PKG_CONFIG_PATH to point to the install location.
In addition the LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be set to the install location the libffi.so
can be found.
