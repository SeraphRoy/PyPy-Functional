* arraylen_gc is not handling length bound optimization at all (we need to
  wait till unrolling for tests)
* mark_opaque_pointer is ignored (which is fine until unrolling)
* clean up and unify _corresponding_vtable and vtable fields on SizeDescr
  and check if all the usecases are necessary
* implement unrolling
