How to add grammar support for our pattern matching
1. In file pypy / pypy / interpreter / pyparser / data / Grammar2.7, define a new matching statement
test: bunch of 'and' 'or' 'not' tests combined with if else and lambda statement
suite: a simple statement or a new stmt at new line

compound_stmt: if_stmt | while_stmt | for_stmt | try_stmt | with_stmt | funcdef | classdef | decorated | matching_stmt
matching_para: expr | test
matching_stmt: 'match' '(' expr ')' ':' with matching_para ':' expr ( with matching_para ':' expr )*

above grammar is likely to cause ambigious but I am going to fix it later.

2. In file pypy / pypy / interpreter / astcompiler / tools / Python.asdl, add a new node for matching statement and matching_para

// not sure how to handle this one yet
matching_para = Expression(expr body)

stmt = FunctionDef(identifier name, arguments args,
                   stmt* body, expr* decorator_list) 
       | ClassDef(identifier name, expr* bases, stmt* body, expr* decorator_list)
       | For(expr target, expr iter, stmt* body, stmt* orelse)
       | While(expr test, stmt* body, stmt* orelse)
       | Matching( expr target, matching_para* mp, expr* vals )

3. In file pypy / pypy / interpreter / astcompiler / ast.py, define a new class Matching
the new Matching class should contain following functions
* __init__
* walkabout(self, visitor)
* mutate_over(self, visitor)
* to_object(self, space)
* from_object(space, w_node)

// haven't figure out how to do it
// no sure if this code can be auto generate or I have to write it through

4. If everything was implemented correctly, now we have a choice. When we visited Matching node in AST, we can either generate the corresponding byte code or we can repalce the matching node with a set of other existing node that will perform the same functionality.

If we decide to generate the bytecode for matching, we will need to modify the pypy / pypy / interpreter / astcompiler / codegen.py to add the rule for matching.

If we decide to repalce the matching node with other existing nodes, we won't need to deal with the byte code.
