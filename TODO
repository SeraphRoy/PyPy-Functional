* python setup.py install in numpy does not somehow tell setuptools
  it's installed (I bet it's about the py27 tag)
* reduce size of generated c code from slot definitions in slotdefs.
* fix py_string_as_string_unicode-getstringandsize_unicode which 
  segfaults when run -A after printing '.', the same test passes cpython -A
  and untranslated
* export ndarrayobject objects like PyArrayObject, PyArrayDescrObject needed
  to coninue using micronumpy as a numpy 1.10 ndarray alternative
  This used to be done with pypy-specific headers which replaced upstream's
  headers, can be tested by installing matplotlib or aubio (pypy/numpy issue #47)
